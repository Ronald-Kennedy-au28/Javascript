//  compilers and interpreters.

// // An interpreter processes each line in the program one by one and if an error
//  is encountered on any line, it is reported then and there. On the other hand,
//   a compiler processes the entire program at once and at the end, it reports 
//   all the errors (if any) in the entire program.

// // Please note that JavaScript is interpreted and not compiled. However, 
// there are compilers too available for JavaScript.

// // Only alphabets, numbers, $ and _ are allowed in a variable name. 
// No other character is allowed.
// // You cannot start a variable name with a number. It can start with 
// only an alphabet or a $ sign or an _.
