// Question :The second argument of event listeners is a callback function 
// in synchronous programming.

// Answer :âœ• Incorrect
// Feedback:
// It is correct that the second argument of event listeners is a callback 
// function which is invoked when the event specified as the first argument is fired.
//  But the next part of the statement is wrong. The event listeners are not a 
//  part of synchronous programming as they are written in code at one place but
//   they are executed only when the event occurs, thus making them part of 
//   'asynchronous' programming in JavaScript.
