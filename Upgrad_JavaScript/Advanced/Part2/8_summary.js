// Summary

// In this session, you learned about:

// ECMAScript, which is a trademarked scripting language specification standardized by ECMAScript
// International. This specification governs JavaScript language by providing a set of rules and
// guidelines which JavaScript must conform to.  

// JavaScript Engine, which interprets and executes JavaScript code in the browser. 
// Different releases of ECMAScript specification - involving ES2015 (popularly known as ES6) 
// released in 2015, which brought major changes in the JavaScript language.
// Babel, which is the JavaScript compiler that converts the code written in ES6 (or later versions)
// to the ES5 code, which is understood by most of the browsers.
// You also looked at some of the differences between ES5 and ES6 syntax. Following are some of the
// points followed by the new syntax in ES6:

// Declaring variables with two new keywords - let and const. The former is used when you wish to
// change the value of the variable in future and the latter is used when you do not wish to 
// change the value of the variable. Unlike var, the variables declared using let/const keywords 
// are not hoisted.

// Classes, which are syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing functions and help in achieving 
// what is so-called prototype-based inheritance in ES5.

// Arrow functions, which is a new syntax over traditional functions and are used to write code 
// quickly and more effectively. They also solve some of the problems, as we see with the 
// context w.r.t. 'this' keyword.

// Array methods - map(), filter(), reduce() methods, which are used to iterate over an array and is
// a much simpler and quicker way to perform operations on an array as compared to its alternative
// methods.

// The powerful three dots - referred to as the spread operator as well as the rest parameters, 
// depending upon the context in which they are used. When used as spread operator, they are 
// used to segregate an array into its individual elements. When used as the rest parameters, 
// they are used to treat individual arguments passed to a function as a combined array in the 
// function parameters.

// Template Literals, which are better way of concatenating string literals. 
// Ways of destructuring an array or an object to extract the its individual elements or keys.

// import and export keywords - used for importing and exporting modules (including variables,
// functions, classes, etc.) defined in one file to be used in another file so as to maintain 
// code reusability and reduce redundancy.
