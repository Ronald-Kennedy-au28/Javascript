// 1) All the primitive data types in JavaScript are passed by value and the custom types such as objects and arrays are passed by reference.

// 2) When a variable refers to an object or an array, the "value"contained in the variable is a reference to the object / array.

// 3) Changing the value of a variable never changes the underlying primitive or object / array, it just points the variable to a new primitive or object / array.

// 4) Changing a property of an object / array referenced by a variable changes the property in the referenced object / array.
