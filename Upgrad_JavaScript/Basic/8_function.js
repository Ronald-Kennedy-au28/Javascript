// A function can be declared without a name and its body can become the value of a
// variable. In short, a variable can store a function. Such functions are called 
//anonymous functions because they do not have any name of their own. The syntax of
// such a function is:
 

var x = function(){
   // function code here
}
x();

// So you just learn one very important distinction between function and method.
// A method is a function thatâ€™s assigned to a key in an object.
