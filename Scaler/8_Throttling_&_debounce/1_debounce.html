    // 1. Debouncing is a technique in programming that helps improve the performance of web applications by 
    // controlling the frequency at which time-consuming tasks are triggered.
    // 2. Debouncing prevents extra activations or slow functions from triggering too often.
    // 3. to avoid unnecessary or repeated function calls that might be expensive or time-consuming
