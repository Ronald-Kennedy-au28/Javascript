// // Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, 
// subtraction, multiplication and division.

// // Relational operators are used to check if the relation that has been specified 
// between the operands is right or wrong and this is why, the result of relational 
// operators is not a number, but instead, either true or false.

// // Logical operators take boolean values and return a boolean value as a result. 
// You can also give expressions but these expressions must evaluate to either true or false.
// // The three most commonly used logical operators are AND (&&), OR (||) and NOT (!). 

// // The equality operator which is represented by == checks if two values are equal or not.
//  This is different from the assignment operator = which is used to assign a value 
//  from the right-hand side to the variable on the left-hand side.

// // JavaScript has six primitive datatypes - string, number, boolean, null, 
// undefined (five types in ES5) and Symbol (sixth type in ES6).
