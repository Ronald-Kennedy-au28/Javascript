How event propagates ==> Event Propagation

Three phases:
1. Capturing phase
2. Target phase
3. Bubbling phase

                    html
                     |
    Capturing       body                Bubbling
      phase          |                  phase
                    grandParent
                     |
                    Parent
                     |
                    child

                Target=>child
                

1. Capturing phase happens from html - child
2. Target phase is where the event happens
3. Bubbling phase is the event execution where it console.logs all the three (gp,Parent,child)
// default all events are in Bubbling phase unless the third parameter is passed in the event(true/false)
