// Summary
// In this session, you learned about:

// JavaScript being a single-threaded language; yet the way it showcases the
// asynchronous behavior.

// Callbacks - the functions which are to be called when some predefined action is completed 
// and when there are multiple levels of callbacks inside callbacks, the triangular shape 
// that is formed is known as the callback hell, which makes the code hard to read, maintain,
// and debug.

// Promises, which is the new way of writing the asynchronous functions and are useful 
// for converting the callback hells into much more readable and manageable code.
// They have two properties:
// state: Initially, when the promise is defined, its state is pending. The state changes
// to fulfilled / rejected once the producing code produces some result.
// result - Initially, when the promise is defined, the result is initialized to undefined.
// Once the producing code finishes its execution, the result is set to the output of this code.

// async and await, which are the keywords introduced in ES8 to write asynchronous functions in 
// JavaScript. They are even better way of writing code as compared to callbacks and promises.
